# [The Christmas party drinking list üç∏](https://adventofsql.com/challenges/10)

## Description
Santa has noticed a drop in workshop productivity, with elves exhibiting concerning behaviors, such as sleeping in wrapping paper bins and overly festive singing during work hours. He's concerned that holiday beverage consumption, particularly alcoholic options like Baileys and Mulled Wine, might be contributing to the issue. Recent incidents, such as poorly painted toy trains, have amplified his worries.

Santa has tasked the Data Elf Analytics team with creating a detailed report on beverage consumption trends in the workshop. He asks Mrs. Claus for help analyzing the data to identify the most consumed drinks and prepare for a "Responsible Revelry" workshop to balance holiday cheer and efficiency. He requests discretion, especially concerning Tinker's fondness for Eggnog "quality control."
